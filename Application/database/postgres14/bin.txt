==> Caveats
==> postgresql@14
Previous versions of postgresql shared the same data directory.

You can migrate to a versioned data directory by running:
  mv -v "/opt/homebrew/var/postgres" "/opt/homebrew/var/postgresql@14"

(Make sure PostgreSQL is stopped before executing this command)

This formula has created a default database cluster with:
  initdb --locale=C -E UTF-8 /opt/homebrew/var/postgres
For more details, read:
  https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/app-initdb.html

To restart postgresql@14 after an upgrade:
  brew services restart postgresql@14
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  /opt/homebrew/opt/postgresql@14/bin/postgres -D /opt/homebrew/var/postgres
