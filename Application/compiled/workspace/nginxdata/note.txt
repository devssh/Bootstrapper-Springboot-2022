==> nginx
Docroot is: /opt/homebrew/var/www

The default port has been set in /opt/homebrew/etc/nginx/nginx.conf to 8080 so that
nginx can run without sudo.

nginx will load all files in /opt/homebrew/etc/nginx/servers/.

To restart nginx after an upgrade:
  brew services restart nginx
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  /opt/homebrew/opt/nginx/bin/nginx -g daemon off;

which nginx
/opt/homebrew/bin/nginx

#To start
launchctl load -w nginx*.plist 
#To stop
launchctl unload nginx*.plist
# or systemctl
Alternative location to add config is servers folder
